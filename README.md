# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject

This course project takes measuremtn data from a IC-Irvine study on Human Activity and transforms it into a tidy dataset using the following instructions:

1. Merge the training and test sets to create one dataset.
2. Extract only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
4. Appropriately label the data with descriptive activity names.
5. Create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

These steps were followed to create a tidy dataset called "tidy_tt.txt".
The code to create this dataset can be found in the file "run_analysis.R"
